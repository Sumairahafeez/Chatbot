## 🤖 How It Works

- User messages are sent from the frontend to the Express.js backend.
- The backend matches keywords or phrases against a rule-based logic file (`chatbotLogic.js`).
- The matched response is sent back to the frontend to be displayed.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- 📝 Add more conversational rules and conditions
- 🌍 Support for multiple languages
- 🗃️ Save chat history with local storage or database
- 🎤 Add voice input/output features
